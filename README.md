cd receipt-processor-java-springboot
```

### 2. Build the Docker image

### Testing Sample Requests (use `sample-request.http` file provided)

You can use **IntelliJ HTTP Client** or **VS Code REST Client** extension to test this.  
The `sample-request.http` file includes examples for the two endpoints:

- `POST /receipts/process` â€“ To submit a receipt and get a unique ID.
- `GET /receipts/{id}/points` â€“ To retrieve the points awarded for that receipt.
